Welcome to my site! My name is Mateo Espinosa and I, at least last time I checked, look approximately like the dude in the picture to the left. I am a computer scientist currently working at [Cerebras Systems][cerebras], a stealth-mode venture-backed startup based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Before joining Cerebras I was a Masters of Engineering student (2016-2017) and an undergraduate student (2013-2016) at [Cornell University][cornellu].

My current interests vary from machine learning and algorithmic game theory to quantum computation and information. While at Cornell, I had the amazing opportunity to work on various research projects from things like swarm synchronization algorithm design and asynchronous training algorithms for neural networks to mathematical-modeling of cell-cycle synchronization. Before Cornell, I was in [Ecuador][chaucha], the beautiful South American country where I was born and raised.

In this site I will be posting random thoughts and projects I get to work on in my free time (or at least that's the idea). In the meantime, if you want to contact me or share some ideas with me, please do not hesitate in [doing so]({{site.base}}/contact).

A small disclaimer: unfortunately, given how things work today, there's the need to say that everything in this blog is highly subjective and one hundred percent my personal opinion, not that of my employers or anyone affiliated with myself.
