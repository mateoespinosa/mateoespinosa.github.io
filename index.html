Welcome to my site! I am a computer scientist and student from the gorgeous and
oxygen-deprived city of <a href="https://youtu.be/_vz_vMacgHs">Quito, Ecuador</a>.
Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of
Cambridge, where I have the extreme luck to be supervised by
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/"> Mateja Jamnik </a> and to be
supported by a <a href="https://www.gatescambridge.org/">Gates Cambridge scholarship</a>.
As part of my research, I am interested in broadening the applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare by making learning algorithms more
interpretable. Specifically, I am interested in concept-based interpretability
and its wider applications to deep learning within medical domains.
If you would like to read more about this, please take a look at my
<a href="/research/">research page</a>.
Whenever I am not breaking things at my daily job and research, I enjoy
needlessly hoarding weird book editions, casually attempting to play pickup
football, and opening way too many articles in my browser thinking I'll be able
to read them all.

In this site I'll be collecting my personal thoughts on what I am sure will be a
seemingly random selection of topics. If you want to know more about my
research or myself, feel free to shoot me an <a href="/contact/">email</a> with
any questions and/or good jokes you may have. In the meantime, I hope you find
some of the posts in this site both slightly entertaining and interesting for
you!
