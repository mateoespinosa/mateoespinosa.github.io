So I have decided to start my own blog. Not that there are not enough blogs out there, but boredom, free time, and some project ideas all got me to think that it would be nice to have a place where I can share what's on my mind these days. I also know this is not the most original thing in the world, but to be honest neither am I. I intend to use this space for sharing everything from computer science, linguistics, and physics related ideas to random thoughts on current events and politics. I've wanted to do something like this for a long time now, and finally got some time to do it. So hopefully this blog will make it pass this first post.

If you are interested about how this website was built, I have included the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) source files in my [github repository](https::/www.github.com/mateoespinosa). Jekyll is a pretty widely used static-site generator, specially for academic blogs. Although there is some sort of a learning curve at the start, it is pretty impressive what you can do with it once you manage to pass that initial warmup stage. Static-site generators are a truly amazing idea. For now, this website is being built with the simplest out-of-the-box theme that Jekyll offers. Nevertheless, I am hopping in making this site less-standard in the future as I further develop this site as a whole. I feel entiled to mention that I got the idea of using Jekyll for this from [Adrian Sampson's](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) website. If you are interested in programming languages, I would strongly recommend going over some of his posts/papers. 

That's it for today. Welcome to my blog and I hope you enjoy going over my random thoughts in the future! More posts will come soon (I hope...)
