Hi! My name is Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga and I, at least last time I checked, look
approximately like the dude in the picture somewhere near this text. I am
currently a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge working on explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) under the supervision of Professor
[Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/).
Before crossing the pond for my MPhil and PhD, I worked for three years and a
half at [Cerebras Systems][cerebras], a machine learning hardware accelerator startup
in the Silicon Valley. During this time, I probably ate my life quota of
sourdough while working on some exciting projects at the intersection of
software and hardware for AI. Previous to that, I lived for four wonderful years
in Ithaca, NY where I was a Masters of Engineering student (2016-2017) and an
undergraduate student (2013-2016) at [Cornell University][cornellu]. Keep in mind that
Ithaca's namesake completely ignores the weather from its Homeric counterpart.
So most of that time was spent happily buried under snow.

I am currently interested in designing learning algorithms that are
able to construct explanations for their predictions in terms of high-level
concepts. If this sounds possibly interesting for you, please take a look at my
[research page](/research/) for a somewhat updated compilation of the work I am doing
these days. Previous to my student life, I was in [Ecuador][chaucha], the beautiful
South American country where I was born and raised.

In this site I will be posting random thoughts and projects I get to work on in
my free time (or at least that's the idea). In the meantime, if you want to
contact me or share some ideas with me (I am always open to collaborations!),
please do not hesitate in [doing so]({{site.base}}/contact).

A small disclaimer: unfortunately, given how things work today, there's the need
to say that everything in this site is highly subjective and one hundred percent
my personal opinion, not that of my employers/supervisors or any institution
affiliated with myself.
