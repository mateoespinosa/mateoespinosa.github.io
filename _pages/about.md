Hi! My name is Mateo Espinosa and I, at least last time I checked, look approximately like the dude in the picture somewhere near this text. I am a computer scientist currently working at [Cerebras Systems][cerebras], a stealth-mode venture-backed machine learning startup based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Before joining Cerebras, I lived for four wonderful years in Ithaca, NY where I was a Masters of Engineering student (2016-2017) and an undergraduate student (2013-2016) at [Cornell University][cornellu]. Keep in mind that Ithaca's namesake completely ignores the whether from its Homeric counterpart. So most of that time was spent happily buried under snow.

My current interests vary from machine learning and algorithmic game theory to quantum computation and information. While at Cornell, I had the amazing opportunity to work on various research projects from things like [autonomous swarm synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01786) and [asynchronous training algorithms for neural networks](https://eyvind.me/blocked-direct-feedback.pdf) to mathematical-modeling of cell-cycle synchronization. Before Cornell, I was in [Ecuador][chaucha], the beautiful South American country where I was born and raised.

In this site I will be posting random thoughts and projects I get to work on in my free time (or at least that's the idea). In the meantime, if you want to contact me or share some ideas with me, please do not hesitate in [doing so]({{site.base}}/contact).

A small disclaimer: unfortunately, given how things work today, there's the need to say that everything in this site is highly subjective and one hundred percent my personal opinion, not that of my employers or anyone affiliated with myself.
