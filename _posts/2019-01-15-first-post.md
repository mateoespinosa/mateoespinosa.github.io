Hello there! So I have decided to start my own blog. Not that there are not enough blogs out there, but boredom and some project ideas got me thinking that it would be nice to have a place where I can share what's on my mind these days. Even if no ones reads them. I also know this is not the most original thing in the world, but to be honest neither am I. Voila! I hope that previous sentence is enough evidence to support itself.
I intend to use this space for sharing everything from computer science, math, linguistics, and physics related ideas to random thoughts on current events and politics. I've wanted to do something like this for a long time now, and finally got some time to do it. So hopefully this blog will make it past this first post. If not, then I hope at least this leftover and lonely post entrained you at for a bit.

As far as why I chose an oddly named, though very interesting, [mathematical theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem) as the name of my blog: I wished I had a deeply rooted philosofical reason for it. But to be honest the rationale behind it is pretty lacking: I chose it because I have always liked the name of that theorem. Nevertheless, the true result of the theorem is itself very interesting and would recommend everyone to take a look at it and its applications in physics and meteorology (hopefully will make a post later on about it). But the true reason behind naming a blog after it, is that its Wikipedia page has this picture in it:

![Hairy Ball Theorem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Baby_hairy_head_DSCN2483.jpg/440px-Baby_hairy_head_DSCN2483.jpg){: .align-center}

If that isn't gold, then I don't know what is. This was slightly better than the [ham sandwitch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem]) whose Wikipedia article literally has a picture of, surprise surprise, a ham sandwich. In case, you know, you've never seen one.

While writing what I intended to be a very brief "hello world" sort-of post, I got sucked in looking up other oddly named mathematical results. And honestly, what a reveling detour this has been. There's the best example of ["Cox-Zucker machine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Zucker_machine), the ["chicken McNugget theorem"](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Chicken_McNugget_Theorem) (kinda cool to know what's the maximum number of McNuggets that you can get by only buying packs of them) and the ["law of the unconscious statistician"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_unconscious_statistician). However, I think the winner has to be the term ["pants decomposition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_of_pants_(mathematics)#Pants_decompositions). Just imagine being serious at a conference or lecture while someone is taking about pants decomposition of curves.

If you are interested in knowing how this website was built, I will include the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) source code in my [GitHub](https://github.com/mateoespinosa/mateoespinosa.github.io). Jekyll is a pretty widely used static-site generator; especially for academic blogs. Although there is some sort of a learning curve at the start, it is pretty impressive what you can do with it once you manage to pass that initial warmup stage. Static-site generators are a truly amazing idea. I really wished I knew of them back in the days of struggling with handwritten CSS and HTML always doing the opposite I wanted them to do.

For now, this website is being build with a Jekyll theme called [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). It is very flexible and offers a tremendous ammount of options (plus relatively good docs), so would recommend it if you are planning on exploring using Jekyll as a base for your website. I certaintly deserves attention. Obviously, feel free to use any of my own personal code as you wish in your own projects without asking.

Before finishing this intro post, I want to mention that I got the idea of using Jekyll, as well as an idea for the basic structure of this project, from [Adrian Sampson's](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) website. If you are interested in programming languages, and in general cool interesting posts/papers, I would strongly recommend going over his website.

That's it for today. Welcome to my blog and I hope you enjoy going over my random thoughts in the future! More posts will come soon (I hope...)
