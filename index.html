Welcome to my site! I am a overly-excited and curious computer scientist from
the gorgeous and oxygen-deprived city of
<a href="https://youtu.be/_vz_vMacgHs">Quito, Ecuador</a>. Whenever I am not
breaking things at my daily job and research, I enjoy needlessly hoarding weird
book editions, casually attempting to play pickup soccer, and opening way too
many articles in my browser thinking I'll be able to read them all.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In this site I'll be collecting my personal thoughts on what I am sure will be a
seemingly random selection of topics. If you want to know more about my
background, feel free to look in
<a href="/about/">here</a> or shoot me an <a href="/contact/">email</a> with any
questions and/or good jokes you may have. In the meantime, I hope you find some
of the posts in this blog both slightly entertaining and interesting for you!
